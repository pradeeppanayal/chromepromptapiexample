This project demonstrates a modern, full-screen chat UI powered by Chrome’s Prompt API.
It mimics real chat applications with left/right message bubbles, a typing indicator with animated dots, and input locking to prevent multiple messages while the AI is responding.

The app runs entirely in the browser, requires a user gesture for model initialization, and supports basic markdown-style formatting like **bold**.
